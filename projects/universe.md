A very painful experience in 2003 was so intolerable that in order to survive I had to let go of everything. In the process of falling, screaming with eyes open, an epiphany connected Uprooted and created the NeuroMorphic Universe. This universe is heavily populated with NeuroMorphic Trees and 'I guys'.

The NeuroMorphic Universe exists in the realm of 'FlatLand' but has dimensions that go beyond the flat.
It is microscopic and macroscopic simultaneously.

My interest in archaeology as a metaphor for the unconscious (as presented by Sigmund Freud) led me to the use of 'stones' (saxa loquuntur) along with my NeuroMorphic Trees . The stones are simultaneously cellular. The NeuroMorphic Trees and stones embody archaelogically what is hidden and unconscious (what must be excavated/found/unearthed/search for self/meaning), as well as time and life.

The NeuroMorphic Universe project includes the poetic 'Words are Seeds' project.
