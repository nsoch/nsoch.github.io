>Andy Warhol is emblematic of contemporary art insider culture.
'Move Over Andy' is a project displays the relevance of contemporary American Hispanic culture in art.
This project is a political sociological statement for Hispanic culture. It grew out of Americana Hispana project.
Currently I am still constructing the work.
Once I have enough work in this project I will upload it for viewing.
