>I have been a gardener all of my adult life. As a child I collected seeds for 'La Reforma Agraria' in Cuba. As an undergrad I sowed seeds 
in paper cups in my Boston apartment. Later when I owned a home I hybridzed daylilies. The life force of seeds has always been a wondrous 
entity that gives me great awe just to be alive. I view words as seeds (or at times as viral infections).

A short poem I wrote in May 2018: "My forest envelopes my soul like a small cocoon. In the wilderness of modern civilization my forest 
saves me from insanity. It nurtures my created need for soul and communion. I stand small, bewildered, grateful for the time I am alive."
Natacha wildDreamer.

'In my Garden' project was a performative process of walking thorough my garden, later collecting the seeds which for me held the DNA of
memory of the experience.

I have also collected since 1996 the lint from my family's wash, viewing the lint as a record of experience - a DNA of memory. My family 
participated in this ritual of the 'DNA of Memory'.
