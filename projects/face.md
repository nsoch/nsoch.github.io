Even before the existence of social media sites, the face has been the most powerful icon in all of our lives.
Human babies are born wired from birth to recognize faces in a specific manner.
In some works I have used tapestry, knitting or crocheting as a metaphor for the hand (incontrast to the mind superiority that Marcel 
Duchamp ushered with his conceptual readymades in the 20th century. I am also referring to the importance of labor.

I have also used 'framing' in some works referencing Goffman's sociological essays on 'face'. In addition, my performative work which I call 
the 'Ritual of Giving' has extensively used the face as part of the process, Initially I used food to share as part of the ritual. Later I made 
some small works on paper which I gave to my fellow artists. Eventually as I do now the ritual is centered on a personal portrait as a gesture 
of personal giving.

The RITUAL of Giving is important since so much of society is concerned with taking. This is a performance based body of work that I have 
done for many years.
