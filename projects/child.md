>I have always enjoyed creating works that have no agenda beyond being liked by children. In many ways this has been present in many of my 
conceptual projects.
Allowing myself the freedom to paint with no importance beyond the child, I have a few works in this realm each year.
Many times I have given these works to actual children as a gift.
Just for the joy and pleasure, nothing more.
