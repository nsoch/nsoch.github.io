>Artist books whether involving drawing, painting, photography or sculpture are wonderful small objects.
Many times these books take many years to come to fruition, so sometimes I have regretted selling them to a collector (which is a silly 
sentiment).
I don't have many of these, and have about half a dozen I am still working on.
I have always loved books. They were my salvation as a child.
