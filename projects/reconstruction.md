The 20th Century was obsessed with deconstruction to the point that it lost sight of the bigger picture, even in the arts.

UpRooted in 1999 brought me to the process of Construction/Deconstruction/Reconstruction.

This process led to the interrelationship of emergence, chaos, complexity science, theoretical physics, psychology, and biology, giving rise to a view of creating the new via the process of construction, deconstruction, and finally reconstruction.

Chaos is the ultimate creator of the new.
