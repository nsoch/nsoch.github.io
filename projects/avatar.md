I have been a virtual gamer since 1988. In the 21st century the virtual is a significant and integral part of an individual's identity. In 1996 my children made me aware of the online multiplayer community created in Team Fortress through the M-Player website. In 1997 I was the 'Noble Lady Natacha WildDreamer Master Swordswoman' in Ultima Online. I hated PK (player killing) so I left this online world to be part of Everquest. In 2005 I made a video which encompassed a performative aspect of my virtual avatar which existed as 'natacha wildDreamer' in 'The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind'. In 2006 I became 'Natachita' as part of the World of Warcraft. This ongoing experience is part of the discourse and evolution of human identity in the 21st century.
