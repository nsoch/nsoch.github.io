In 2006 I presented my MFA thesis at Tufts University/School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. Its title was 'NeuroMorphic Universe'. I chose the style of the work influenced by the history of manga and anime in Edo period Japan. I had written a short art history thesis paper on manga and anime and its effect on the 21st Century and was aware of it being a good example of how art can influence cultures slowly and quietly over time (with no need of bloody revolutions).

A very important part of the thesis was 'the Actual Experience is the work of art' as a performative element. I enabled the audience to participate by giving them the option of painting their face or body becoming parts of the the NeuroMorphic Universe. The entire gallery was painted in sky blue intentionally as a metaphor of interconnectedness and representing my cultural bias.

The work comprised three rooms in the Aidekman Gallery at Tufts University. The first room (gallery entrance) had an installation that was a self-portrait. This was presented as a drawing of a NeuroMorphic tree that was the entire wall of the room. A pedestal and bookshelves had important books in my life as well as a few hundred small sculptural 'I guys'. The main gallery space had small and large NeuroMorphic Universe paintings. The third part of the gallery had paintings, 'I guys' throughout the room and a video installation.
