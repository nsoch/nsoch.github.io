>The Boston Painters heritage is a rich tradition of information on how to see the light. It is an unbroken lineage starting from the french 
artist David and extending to Paul Ingbretson who was a student of RH Ives Gammel. As such I also became part of that unbroken lineage of 
knowledge when I studied under Paul, which I greatly treasure.As a physician with knowledge of the working of human anatomy I was able to 
appreciate and understand the principles beyond the actual learning of the practice. I also knew Richard Whitney another pupil of 
RH Ives Gammel and visited with him in his farm in NH. In my practice of art I use these Boston Painters principles when I choose, 
though I did not choose to solely do this particular 'style' as a way to execute all of my work in its myriad of projects.

Every day, five days a week we would start working from light to dusk in the atelier. We had individual studio spaces all with north 
light. For the first year one would solely do the cast in charcoal. This was a time that really had the greates impact in learning how 
to see the light. In the second year we started drawing the live model every day in the same manner as the cast drawings with northern 
light. Lastly we then segued into painting with oils and this was the time period that I decided to leave the atelier as I did not want 
to ascribe to the rules of composition that were espoused (though I learned them) and the rules that one had to do only the actual color 
that one saw, as I loved just inventing color that may not have been there for the actual visual experience. However, I did a few 
paintings obeying all the rules before leaving the atelier.

My time with Paul Ingbretson was a priceless gift that I am grateful to have had. Otherwise I would never have learned to see the light as it is not knowledge that is widely available in conventional arts education in the undergrduate or graduate level.

Though I cannot 'site-size' in my encounters sharing a live model with fellow artists nowadays, I still site size at my private studio 
if I wish.
