<p>Art cannot escape being a sociological object. Art objects can attempt to escape the constraints of reality, but they cannot escape the values, experience, and knowledge of the artist that created them. On a personal note creating objects is a ritual and a performance that gives meaning to my life. While creating work I struggle with contextual meaning, ideas, expression, and the ironic immutability of change.</p>


<p>I use my labor to create the work. Labor is a state to be valued, and not to be exploited by any society. My predominant objection to the late 20th Century conceptual movement has been the underlying exploitation of labor by stating that the mind (idea) is more important than the hand. However, the mind is the hand. That part of the conceptual thus is emblematic of capitalistic exploitation of labor. I am a fervent believer of Capitalism but the type of capitalism that is good is the kind that is based on the small individual enterprise that rewards the laborers without exploitation. Systems that are hugely pyramidal with predominantly the pinnacle receiving the rewards at the cost of the larger masses below them are unethical, and create non-dynamic economic systems since it cuts the spending ability of the greater population. Economic systems such as Communism are just as bad as the monopolistic capitalist systems with an elite pinnacle. Communism has a mafia type totalitarian elite at the top with no freedom of speech and ideas. Systems like the totalitarianism of Communism fool the masses into thinking that wealth is being fairly distributed but in reality it is not. Any form of economic system that does not allow representative Democracy is morally corrupt. In light of the present world economic picture it is even more imperative that the Conceptual art world be responsibly aware of what it is doing in the part of its practice that denigrates the hand and should reflect moral support for labor. The conceptual world of the 20th century increasingly and routinely separated the mind from the hand. This belief of the supremacy of the mind over the hand was regressive in that it mirrored the philosopher Rene Descartes' (1596-1630) mind-body separation. As an artist I value the conceptual aspect of work but I do not divorce the mind from the body. It is important for art to embody not only ideas, but also wonder, resonance and the integrity of the human hand.</p>


<p>The act of creating artistic works aids humans in their relationship to reality and meaning. Homo sapiens ability to make connections has enabled the species to become survivors in evolution and some of the power of art lies in this ability to enable connections. These connections go beyond what the artist intended and what the politically and economically powerful in society sanction. These connections facilitate cultural exchange and dialogue when language alone is ineffective. Art is an excellent medium for (intra and inter) cultural exchange because it allows the viewer to become part of the dialogue and expand meaning beyond the artist's intentions. It is a medium through which things that are intangible and not connected by the concrete, have a chance to come into human awareness. This interweaving of cultures via objects has always existed. Cultural cannibalism, slowly over time, negates the dominance of Empires. Whether placed in political terms of power relations or in philosophical, sociological, or biological arenas, the ‘framing’ is not important. The end result, the evolution of culture and societies, will be the same.</p>


<p>Another presently popular contemporary conceptual dialogue is the quality of celebrity itself. The expression of art being predominantly the cult of spectacle and celebrity has become ubiquitous and yet boring at best. As artists we should contribute to contemporary dialogue and create work that has integrity and goes beyond the celebrity obsession of our society. This dialogue is important, as our society is drowning with the superficiality of reality media shows and the cult of celebrity is destroying our ability to think for ourselves. Ultimately art is about absolute personal freedom. Yet we should be responsible contributors to culture, not merely by criticizing, but actually living our lives as role models and creating objects that go beyond the superficial and the spectacle. In the end, we must remember that Art is about freedom and as such, Art should have no required dogmas as its pre-requisite for validation. Art education has become too controlling of ideas as a pre-requisite for validation. Yet a work needs intelligence, experience, knowledge, wonder and resonance so the viewer can be drawn into it's world. 

While in graduate school I was well aware of the limitations of critical theory. I found a wonderful article that summarized many of my concerns with critical theory in this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/docs/articles/critical_theory_article.pdf" target="_blank">American Scholar article</a>. My work has been a series of projects that are conceptually related as they have grown out of each other and my philosophical viewpoint. However, visually they can be very different since each project may need a more particular approach and may necessitate a different visual style for the expression of a particular idea, or I may feel it needs to be more playful for the viewer. So for me I am not imprisoned by one dominant style as were the modernists or postmodernists in execution their individual work. For me, everything is an abstraction with different degrees of 'recognizability'.</p>

She worked as a professional photographer in Berlin, Germany including freelance work for "Berlin Today" magazine. She is a Summa Cum Laude graduate of Boston University (BA Biology with distinction, minor art history) and received her MD degree from Boston University School of Medicine. Her post-baccalaureate studies at Brandeis University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston included painting, printmaking, photography, and video. She received her MFA in Studio Arts from Tufts University/School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Her knowledge of the sciences has greatly contributed to her art. From 1995 to 1997 she learned how to see the light as an artist from Paul Ingbretson at his atelier that embodied the Boston Painters heritage and lineage in Framingham Massachusetts and later in Manchester NH. This knowledge contributed to her ability to create diverse work when she coupled it with her graduate work in the arts at the Museum School.</p>


<p>She has taught at numerous places including School fo the Museum of Fine Arts (painting), the New Hampshire Institute of Art (drawing and printmaking), and was Master Teacher in Studio Arts at the St. Paul's School Advanced Studies Program (Concord, NH). She is an interdisciplinary thinker, curator, and artist including painting, printmaking, bookmaking, performance, video, drawing, and photography. Her work has won numerous awards and has been in exhibitions throughout the United States. She was a member of the College Art Association and served on the Board of the Woman's Caucus for Art (NH), including President WCA NH, Vice- President, and webmaster.</p>

 
<p>In 2009 Natacha founded NKG (a Boston contemporary art gallery) along with Kathy Halamka. NKG (NK Gallery LLC) gave voice to the pluralism that continually enriches contemporary art and ideas. NKG's mission was to further contemporary art by giving equal value to the mind and the hand. NKG supported artists by giving time and space to exhibit work. In 2012 NKGallery closed it's doors.</p>

 
<p>From early childhood Natacha has been passionate about art and science and to the present keeps these worlds connected. Her interests include philosophy, theoretical physics, ethics, critical thinking, biological and sociological systems, as well as virtual gaming. Natacha is bilingual from birth and is the oldest child of Puerto Rican and Cuban parents. Her father Mario was involved in the Cuban Revolution and this experience as a child has influenced not only her life and her view of culture but her work as well. Her mother's diverse roots contributed to her life perspective. In 2015 Natacha left her farm in NH and moved to Raleigh NC.</p>
