<h2>POSTCONCEPTUAL FRAGMENTS</h2>

<p>I have been an artist all of my life. In 1998 I called myself Natacha wildDreamer and had wildDreamerStudio.com as my website. 
 Simultaneously I started natacha.net at that time. When I did my MFA in Studio Art at the SMFA Boston/Tufts University I learned a 
 great deal about our contemporary art world. I developed a scholarly understanding of self in the setting of the objects I create. 
 I learned the underlying reasons why I needed to make work. I labeled myself as a postconceptual pluralist in 2003. I am thankful 
 for the multidisciplinary experience at the SMFA Boston in terms of giving me the foundation to expand the diversity of work over 
 these past 30 years.</p>


<p>While in graduate school we studied various philosophies. I discovered that art cannot escape being a sociological object. I was 
introduced to critical theory but found it problematic. I found a wonderful article that summarized many of my concerns with critical 
theory in this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/docs/articles/critical_theory_article.pdf" target="_blank">American Scholar article</a>.
My philosophical education made me aware of the contextual/conceptual meaning of my objects, simultaneously being aware of the mode of 
expression/style I chose, and the scale of the ojject created.</p>


<p>I prefer not to concretely explain each individual work, but rather, that the viewer see the work freshly without the constraints of 
 words. I use iconography which has multilayered meaning. A have a compendium of Projects - analogous to individual ‘books’ - each 
 page of the book signifying a separate yet connected visual experience. Style is an element, analogous to choice of color but not tied 
 to the past temporal importance of style. The style of a project is relevant to what I feel best fits its conceptual aspects, however, 
 there is no rule that it cannot be arbitrarily chosen by personal preferences.</p>


<p>As an artist/scientist I am aware that nature’s only constant is change. My fascination with the sciences simultaneously with making 
 objects underlies all of my work. The scientific process of analyzing an object, initially by its parts in order to understand the 
 whole, is a process that leads to many exciting discoveries. Construction, deconstruction and then reconstruction have contributed 
 to my creating new objects. Complexity science, emergence, and chaos are processes I employ along with intuition. Before the advent 
 of computers many things not understood where deemed chaotic. Now we can easily see that what was once chaos is merely elegantly 
 complex.</p>

<p>I am not religious, but I am a spiritual person. For me, ‘god’ has no religion.<p>
   
<p>I am Hispanic/Latina first generation American. My mother was Puerto Rican of mixed ethnicity, and my father was Cuban from Spaniard 
parents. I include this tidbit as all the things that comprise an individual contribute to their art.<p>

<p> My intimate exposure to the Cuban revolution as a young child made me aware of the importance of a just society, financially and 
politically. I question everything.<p> 
   
<p>I use my labor to create the work. Labor is a state to be valued, and should not to be exploited by society. My predominant objection
 to the late 20th Century conceptual movement, initiated by Marcel Duchamp, devalued the hand over the superiority of the mind. 
 However, the hand is the mind.<p>
    
 <p>At this moment our society is at a dangerous intersection. Ironically, democracy is such an open system that it can be easily abused
  and distorted beyond recognition. Democracy can be lost. Greed is the enemy of democracy.<p>

<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>Natacha Villamia Sochat was born in New York City. She grew up in La Habana, Cuba and in the south Bronx where and attended the Bronx HS of Science. She worked as a professional photographer in Berlin, Germany including freelance work for "Berlin Today" magazine. She is a Summa Cum Laude graduate of Boston University (BA Biology with distinction, minor art history) and received her MD degree from Boston University School of Medicine. Her post-baccalaureate studies at Brandeis University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston included painting, printmaking, photography, and video. She received her MFA in Studio Arts from Tufts University/School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Her knowledge of the sciences has greatly contributed to her art. From 1995 to 1997 she learned how to see the light as an artist from Paul Ingbretson at his atelier that embodied the Boston Painters heritage and lineage in Framingham Massachusetts and later in Manchester NH. This knowledge contributed to her ability to create diverse work when she coupled it with her graduate work in the arts at the Museum School.</p>


<p>She has taught at numerous places including School fo the Museum of Fine Arts (painting), the New Hampshire Institute of Art (drawing and printmaking), and was Master Teacher in Studio Arts at the St. Paul's School Advanced Studies Program (Concord, NH). She is an interdisciplinary thinker, curator, and artist including painting, printmaking, bookmaking, performance, video, drawing, and photography. Her work has won numerous awards and has been in exhibitions throughout the United States. She was a member of the College Art Association and served on the Board of the Woman's Caucus for Art (NH), including President WCA NH, Vice- President, and webmaster.</p>

 
<p>In 2009 Natacha founded NKG (a Boston contemporary art gallery) along with Kathy Halamka. NKG (NK Gallery LLC) gave voice to the pluralism that continually enriches contemporary art and ideas. NKG's mission was to further contemporary art by giving equal value to the mind and the hand. NKG supported artists by giving time and space to exhibit work. In 2012 NKGallery closed it's doors.</p>

 
<p>From early childhood Natacha has been passionate about art and science and to the present keeps these worlds connected. Her interests include philosophy, theoretical physics, ethics, critical thinking, biological and sociological systems, as well as virtual gaming. Natacha is bilingual from birth and is the oldest child of Puerto Rican and Cuban parents. Her father Mario was involved in the Cuban Revolution and this experience as a child has influenced not only her life and her view of culture but her work as well. Her mother's diverse roots contributed to her life perspective. In 2015 Natacha left her farm in NH and moved to Raleigh NC.</p>
